My name is Csongor. I am an enthusiast of **mathematics**, **programming**, and a sport enthusiastics with my main focus on **orienteering**. So if you are interested in any of these topics you might find interesting contents in my site.

Currently, I am a PhD candidate in Uppsala University under the supervision of [Prashant Singh](https://www.prashantsingh.se/). My research considers optimization of ill-posed problems both from the theoretical and applied point of view focusing on inverse mappings in simulation based inference problems and machine learning.

I am doing my best to keep the page content up to date about my research and teaching duties as well as publish some of my notes on topics interesting to me. 

You can find more information about me and my interests from the [About me](/about/about) page.

Finally, I extend an open invitation to all who wish to collaborate, or just engage in meaningful discussions. You can find contact details on the bottom of the site.
