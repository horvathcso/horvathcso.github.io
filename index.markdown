# Greetings, esteemed visitors!

<img style="float: right; margin: 5px 20px;  border-radius:20px; " src="\img\profil.JPG" alt="Profile picture" width="20%" height="20%">
Allow me to introduce myself. I am Csongor, an enthusiast of **mathematics**, **programming**, and the captivating sport of **orienteering**. So if you are interested in any of these you may find interesting contents in my site.

Currently I am a PhD candidate in Uppsala University under the supervision of [Prashant Singh](https://www.prashantsingh.se/). My research considers optimization of ill-posed problems both from the theoretical and applied point of view focusing on inverse mappings and machine learning.

I will try to keep my page up to date. I am planning to add notes on interesting scientific topics and keep up an orienteering blog about my training and racing journey. I may publis occasional non-scientifics thought provoking writings as well.

You can find more information about me and my interests from the [About me](/about/about) page.

Finally, I extend an open invitation to all who wish to collaborate, or just engage in meaningful discussions. You can find contact details on the bottom of the site.
