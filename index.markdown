# Greetings, esteemed visitors!

<img style="float: right; margin: 5px 20px;" src=".\img\profil.jpg" alt="Profile picture" width="20%" height="20%">
Allow me to introduce myself. I am Csongor, an ardent enthusiast of **mathematics**, **programming**, and the captivating sport of **orienteering**. So if you are interested in any of these you may find interesting contents in my site.

My academic journey has taken me through the hallowed halls of ELTE in Budapest, Hungary, where I pursued a bachelor's degree in pure mathematics. Presently, I am pursuing a master's degree in computational science at Uppsala University in Sweden. These years of dedicated study have granted me invaluable insights into the field. Although I received excellent grades during my studies, I must admit that I am unable to hold all of this information in my head.

As a result, I've made the decision to attempt to systematize my knowledge and, why not,share it on the internet. Summaries of the subjects, which fascinate me can be found under the Education page. Although writing this content is motivated by my desire to advance personally, I do hope that it will be useful to others as well. In addition, I want to start an orienteering blog where I can discuss this exhilarating exercise and offer insights based on my own experiences.

Join me on this intellectual journey as we dig into the fascinating worlds of orienteering, programming, and mathematics. Welcome, and let the pursuit of knowledge begin! 

Finally, I extend an open invitation to all who wish to engage in meaningful discussions, collaborate on exciting projects, or simply connect with a fellow enthusiast. If you have any questions, ideas, or even a humorous anecdote to share, I would be delighted to hear from you. Please do not hesitate to reach out through the contact information provided at the bottom of this website. I eagerly await the opportunity to connect with you. Until then, happy exploring!
