# Professional Introduction

## My professional interest
Throughout my academic journey, my passion for mathematics has been deeply intertwined with the most influential domains in Hungarian mathematics. From my early years in high school, I developed a profound interest in discrete mathematics, with a particular fascination for graph theory and combinatorics. Within graph theory, I am particularly interested in coloring problems and network flows, additionally the characterization of various classes of graphs has always had a great impact on me, which was also the topics of my bachelor thesis titles: [*Chordal graphs and leaf powers* (Hungarian)](https://www.math.elte.hu/thesisupload/thesisfiles/2022bsc_mat3y-xfhq76.pdf).

In addition to these areas, during my bachelor I became familiar with and interested in operations research and optimization tasks in general, including game theory and transport problems. I also found my computational theory subject to be extremely interesting.

During my master's degree, I began to show a deep interest in new fields in computer science, as I gained more insight into the given subject. One of which was the numerical modeling of differential equations, primarily using FEM and FDM. Still on the theoretical side, I found a deeper interest for mathematical modeling, during my class on modeling complex systems.
In addition, I was lucky enough to learn about low-level and parallel programming using C/C++/CUDA and pthread/MP/MPI, which I also liked.
: I chose my Master thesis topics as the most interesting I could find in the topics of Optimization in the university. I ended up studying ill-posed optimization for neural networks and inverse-problems. The focus was on the understanding of the landscape of the loss function and it's relation with generalization as well as controlling the quality of the solution during the optimization process. During this I gained experience implementing state-of-the-art methods for training neural networks and studied the possible applications on toy problems of a modified version of SAM (Sharpness-Aware minimization), one of the currently known best optimization method for neural networks. It had the title [Studying Solution Quality for Ill-Posed Optimization Problems](https://uu.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?aq2=%5B%5B%5D%5D&c=1&af=%5B%5D&searchType=SIMPLE&sortOrder2=title_sort_asc&query=csongor+horvath&language=en&pid=diva2%3A1878299&aq=%5B%5B%5D%5D&sf=all&aqe=%5B%5D&sortOrder=author_sort_asc&onlyFullText=false&noOfRows=50&dswid=-8555).

I was working using scrum an agile software development framework. The task were involving full-stack JAVA development in the new services of the company. 

### MasterCard Summer Internship (2023 Jun-Aug)

During my time in the team of MasterCard D&S I worked closely with [Szabolcs Tüske](https://www.linkedin.com/in/szabolcstuske/), my main tasks concerned modelling of fraud predictions based on available data for a client and preparing presentation regarding the project based on our model and available experts knowledge on fraud prevention in the companies database. I also earned enormous support from my people maneger [Anna Emese Takács](https://www.linkedin.com/in/annaemesetakacs/), who tried to introduce me into the more data analytics part of the work being done at Mastercard. 
: I really enjoyed the youthful and energized atmosphere during my internship even though my main strength lies in the theoretical knowledge and not in the consultant part of the processes. I am also happy that together with my international team of interns we achieved 1st place in the Mastercard summer intern innovation challenge with our idea of making payment more inclusive for underprivileged by easily implementable IT solutions. 

## Background
I grew up in Budapest, Hungary, where my passion for mathematics and algorithms began during my early years. Participating in math competitions from the second grade onwards nurtured my love for problem-solving. Throughout high school, I excelled in both math and physics competitions, achieving outstanding results. While I learned programming during this time, my primary interest remained focused on the mathematical theory behind computations and due to lack of preparation and interest I hadn't achieve significant results in competitive programming.

In the last 6 years of my high school I was studying in the advanced math class of [Szent István Gimnázium](https://szigbp.hu/), where I learned a lot from my teachers (Ildikó Molnár-Séska and Péter Juhász) in the area of maths as well as from my classmates, which motivated me at the day-to-day work. 
During this time I also participated in weekend math camps organized by the [Joy of Thinking Foundation](https://en.agondolkodasorome.hu/). These camps, designed for the country's most talented students, allowed me to work alongside exceptional peers such as Dávid Matolcsi and Dávid Szabó, who were renowned math talents in our grade an part of the IMO team. Under the guidance of Péter Juhász and Lajos Pósa, I honed my skills and developed a deep appreciation for logical thinking and mathematics. I am exceptionally grateful for Péter, who not just in the weekend camps, but also in my regular math class had a lasting effect on me not just in the area of mathematics, but also as a person. He also influenced my later academics career significantly.

## Extracurricular Activities

Alongside my bachelor studies, I joined the organizing team of the [Dürer Competition](https://durerinfo.hu/), a team-based natural science contest for high school students. I contributed to problem sheet preparation and corrections in both mathematics and physics. Additionally, I had the privilege of organizing the final round, which provided both an enjoyable experience and a significant responsibility. For two years from 2020 till 2022 I was in charge of the creation of the math problem sheets for the C category, which is held for 9th and 10th-grade students. The problem sheets coordinated by me can be found in the website of the competition in english as well ([2020-21](https://durerinfo.hu/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/XIV_Durer_angol_kiadvany.pdf), [2021-22](https://durerinfo.hu/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/XV.-Durer-angol-kiadvany.pdf)).

During the first two year of my studies, I also participated in the correction process of the maths problems for [KÖMAL](https://www.komal.hu/home.h.shtml), a monthly problem-solving contest for high school students.

In 2022, I served as the head of the organizing committee for the [TIPO Cup](https://adatbank.mtfsz.hu/esemeny/show/esemeny_id/7741), a regular orienteering competition hosted by my club, which attracted around 500 participants for all of it's three stages. 

I also volunteered as a guide at the European Girls' Mathematical Olympiad (EGMO) in 2022 held in Eger, Hungary. There I had the chance to get to know a bunch of the brightest math talent in the word and organize free time activities for them.

In 2020 I also gained membership based on my academics merits to the Maths and Phisics group of the [Eötvös József College for Advanced Studies](https://eotvos.elte.hu/departmens/matematika-fizika-muhely?m=9342). Engaging in extracurricular math and language lessons within a stimulating intellectual environment proved immensely rewarding. I also had the opportunity to taught math to younger students there, where I shared insight into topics for which I am passionate about such as chordal graphs and greeko-latin squares. I actively participated in social activities within the college. These activities ranged from the organization of camps welcoming new students and participating in several board meetings to actively getting involved in the sport activities, leading hikes and having fun in the college's basement club by dancing or discussing math until 4 p.m. in almost every Thursdays. These social activities rewarded me with unforgettable memories and lasting friendships next to the knowledge gained in the professional workshops.
