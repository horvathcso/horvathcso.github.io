# Professional Introduction
## Background
I grew up in Budapest, Hungary, where my passion for mathematics and algorithms began during my early years. Participating in math competitions from the second grade onwards nurtured my love for problem-solving. Throughout high school, I excelled in both math and physics competitions, achieving outstanding results. While I learned programming during this time, my primary interest remained focused on the mathematical theory behind computations.

From seventh grade until I finished high school, I actively participated in weekend camps organized by the Joy of Thinking Foundation. These camps, designed for the country's most talented students, allowed me to work alongside exceptional peers such as Dávid Matolcsi and Dávid Szabó, who were renowned math talents in our grade. Under the guidance of Péter Juhász and Lajos Pósa, I honed my skills and developed a deep appreciation for mathematics. Péter, who later became my regular high school math teacher, had a profound influence on my academic choices and personal growth.

## Bachelor's Degree and Extracurricular Activities
After graduating high school with an excellent diploma, I pursued a Bachelor's degree in pure mathematics at ELTE. The program offered a strong theoretical foundation, renowned as one of the best in Europe. Alongside my studies, I actively participated in the organization of the Dürer Competition, a team-based natural science contest for high school students. I contributed to problem sheet preparation and corrections in both mathematics and physics. Additionally, I had the privilege of organizing the final round, which provided both an enjoyable experience and a significant responsibility. In my final two years, I took charge of creating math problem sheets for 9th and 10th-grade students.

During my first two years at university, I also participated in the correction process for KÖMAL, a monthly problem-solving contest for high school students.

In 2022, I served as the head of the organizing committee for the TIPO Cup, a regular orienteering competition hosted by my club, which attracted around 500 participants. I also volunteered at the European Girls' Mathematical Olympiad (EGMO) in 2022 held in Eger, Hungary.

During my final two years of bachelor's studies, I joined the Eötvös József College for Advanced Studies. Engaging in extracurricular math and language lessons within a stimulating intellectual environment proved immensely rewarding. I actively participated in social activities within the college and also had the opportunity to teach lessons to younger students.

## Bachelor's Thesis and Academic Achievement
For my final thesis during my bachelor's studies, I explored Chordal graphs under the supervision of Zoltán Blázsik. I also engaged in a mathematical research project with him. As a result of my academic accomplishments, I received my diploma with honors, reflecting a GPA equivalent to 3.94 (out of 4) in the US system.

## Pursuing a Master's Degree and Professional Interest
Driven by my interest in applied mathematics, I made the decision to pursue a Master's degree in Computational Science at Uppsala University in Sweden. This program offered an opportunity to expand my knowledge in implementing various algorithms while discovering a newfound interest in numerical modeling.

Regarding my professional interest, I am particularly fascinated by discrete mathematics, graph theory, optimization, numerical modeling (FEM, FDM), mathematical modeling, and networks. I am also intrigued by data analytics, low-level and parallel programming (using C), and the fields of AI and machine learning, which are likely to be the focus of my Master's thesis project.
