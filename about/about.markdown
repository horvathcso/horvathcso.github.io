# Hobbies and interest
## Joy of sports
Growing up, I engaged in a diverse range of sports, and the thrill of physical activity has always been an integral part of my life. During my childhood, I spent countless hours playing football with my peers in the playground. I enthusiastically participated in various local competitions, including running, orienteering, gymnastics, football, athletics and swimming. Apart from combat sports, I regularly dabbled in a wide array of sports including table tennis and badminton.

## Competitive sport

Competitive sport have also been a significant aspect of my life since childhood. At the age of 5, I began attending track running trainings, driven by my parents' desire to channel my energy productively while my sister attended the training. Fueled by a strong sense of competitiveness, I progressively started competing more seriously at the age of 11. Perhaps one of my "greatest achievement" occurred at twelve, when I matched the time of Jakob Ingebrigtsen in the 600m ;) Born in the same year as me, Jakob has since become one of the world's foremost middle distance runners, achieving remarkable success. Unfortunately, since then I lacked his improvement in speed.

On a national level, I garnered notable accomplishments in my age group, winning several national championships for my age group and representing Hungary in several international matches in the region. During high school I was one of the key member of my high school cross-country team, which achieved multiple top 3 position during the years. Our win let us represent Hungary in the school team category for the 2016 ISF cross-country running world championship. However, during the pandemic in 2020, I stopped training competitively due to an injury and luck of motivation. Nevertheless, I managed to achieve noteworthy results in 2022, including winning the team championship title at the National Cross Country Championships in the U23 category. Additionally, I attained my first senior national title with the KSI in the 4x800m relay. I haven't competed in the track ever since.

I also competed in high level at orienteering. I started this sport due to my parents influence, as both of them do orienteering and it is a great family sport, so almost since I was born I spent most of the weekend in orienteering competitions during my youth. I was always competitive, and I manage to stand on the podium several times in the championships. From 2015 till 2018 I was part of the youth national team in each year and I represented Hungary in four EYOC. My best results include a 4th and 5th place with the relay and a 9th place in the sprint at 2016. As the European Championship will be in Hungary in 2024 I started training more seriously in 2022 with the aim to make the Hungarian team. Even though I didn't fully deserve I got a last minute spot in the team and had the chance to struggle though the long distance in the heat and cheer for my teammates on home soil, which is an unforgettable experience.
Currently I am training in Uppsala, where I am doing my PhD studies. Here I am attending the trainings of OK Linn√©, which is my local clubs and in which I am honored to run with some of the world's best orienteer.

From around the age of 10 till 16 I also participated in national level cross-country skiing ang ski-O competitions winning multiple championships in both discipline during the years. I am still doing cross-country skiing from time to time, but due to the lack of snow and facility in Hungary I decided to focus on other sports instead.
