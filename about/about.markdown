# Hobbies and interest
## Joy of sports
Growing up, I engaged in a diverse range of sports, and the thrill of physical activity has always been an integral part of my life. During my childhood, I spent countless hours playing football with my peers in the playground. I enthusiastically participated in various local competitions, including running, orienteering, gymnastics, and swimming. Apart from combat sports, I regularly dabbled in a wide array of sports including table tennis and badminton.

## Competitive sports
Competitive sports have also been a significant aspect of my life since childhood. At the age of 5, I began attending track running trainings, driven by my parents' desire to channel my energy productively while my sister attended the training. Fueled by a strong sense of competitiveness, I progressively started competing more seriously at the age of 11. Perhaps one of my "greatest achievements" occurred at twelve, when I matched the speed of Jakob Ingebrigtsen in the 600m ;) Born in the same year as me, Jakob has since become one of the world's foremost middle distance runners, achieving remarkable success by the age of 21.

On a national level, I garnered notable accomplishments in my age group, winning several national championships. However, during the pandemic in 2020, I stopped training competitively. Nevertheless, I managed to achieve noteworthy results in 2022, including winning the team championship title at the National Cross Country Championships in the U23 category. Additionally, I attained my first senior national title with the KSI in the 4x800m relay.

I also competed in a high level in orienteering, which I am planning to do again. I started this sport due to my parents influence, as both of the do orienteering and it is a great family sport, so almost since I was born I spent most of the weekend in orienteering competitions during my youth. I was always competitive and I manage to stand on the podium several times in the championships. From 2015 till 2018 I was part of the youth national team in each year and I represented Hungary in four EYOC. My best results include a 4th and 5th place with the relay and a 9th place in the sprint at 2016. As the European Championship will be in Hungary in 2024 I started training more seriously last year with the aim to make the Hungarian team. Currently I am training in Uppsala, where I am doing my master studies. Here I am attending the trainings of OK Linn√©, which is my local clubs and in which trainings I am honored to run with some of the world best orienteer.
