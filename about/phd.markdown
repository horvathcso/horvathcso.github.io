# PhD in Scientific Computing (IT department ,Uppsala University) started Sept 2024

Here I share updates about the progress of my PhD. In my case it is supposed to last approximately 5 years, include taking courses at least 70 academic credits (hp), 1 year equivalent of departmental duties including teaching courses and supervising students and other departmental duties. As I am currently in the first year of my PhD, I mostly spent my time on courses and getting familiar with the research projects and supervision master students.

## Courses / Credits taken so far (24.0 / 70.0)

- 7.5hp Advanced probabilistic machine learning - FTN0204 (2024 HT) 
- 5.0hp Statistical Machine Learning - FTN0061 (2024 HT)
- 4.0hp Numerical Linear Algebra - FTN0577 (2024 HT)
- 3.5hp Numerical Optimization - FTN0578 (2024 HT)
- 2.0hp Ethics of Technology and Science, part I - FTN0001 (2025 VT)

    - Teaching assistant for the course 1TD354 Scientific Computing for Partial Differential Equations 5.0hp (2025 HT)

<!-- As a PhD student in the division of Scientific Computing at the Uppsala University's IT department, I feel like scientific communication is a big part of my duties. Therefore, I plan to write monthly, bi-monthly posts about my progress or other interesting topics. Some will be more about my everyday PhD life, some will be more in depth technical or philosophical articles.
