# PhD in Scientific Computing (IT department ,Uppsala University) started Sept 2024

Here I share updates about the progress of my PhD. In my case it is supposed to last approximately 5 years, include 70 academic credits (hp) of courses, 1 year equivalent of departmental duties including teaching courses and supervising students. As I am currently in the first year of my PhD, I mostly spent my time on courses and getting familiar with the research projects and supervision master students.

## Courses / Credits taken so far

- 7.5hp Advanced probabilistic machine learning - FTN0204 (2024 HT) 
- 5.0hp Statistical Machine Learning - FTN0061 (2024 HT)
- 4.0hp Numerical Linear Algebra - FTN0577 (2024 HT)
- 3.5hp Numerical Optimization - FTN0578 (2024 HT)
- 2.0hp Ethics of Technology and Science, part I - FTN0001 (2025 VT)
- Summer school on Generative modelling, [GEMSS and Statlearn](https://gemss.ai/2025/) (2025 VT)

### Courses current and future

- 5.0hp Techniques and Technologies forScientific Software Engineering - FTN0439 (2025 VT)
- 7.5hp [Probability Theory and Statistics](https://www.troscheit.eu/news/phdcourse/) by the maths department (2025 VT)

- 10.0hp [Statistical Learning for Data Science](https://d3c-group.github.io/courses/statistical/) (2025 HT)
- 7.5hp Academic Teacher Training Course (2025 HT)
- 5.0hp Mathematical foundations of scientific computing (2025 HT)
- 5.0hp Simulation technologies (2026 VT)

## Supervising and reviewing student projects



As a PhD student in the division of Scientific Computing at the Uppsala University's IT department, I feel like scientific communication is a big part of my duties. Therefore, I plan to write monthly, bi-monthly posts about my progress or other interesting topics. Some will be more about my everyday PhD life, some will be more in depth technical or philosophical articles.
