As a PhD student in the division of Scientific Computing at the Uppsala University's IT department, I feel like scientific communication is a big part of my duties. Therefore, I plan to write monthly, bi-monthly posts about my progress or other interesting topics. Some will be more about my everyday PhD life, some will be more in depth technical or philosophical articles.
