# PhD in Scientific Computing (IT department, Uppsala University) Sept 2024 -

This page documents the progress of my PhD in Scientific Computing. The program is expected to take approximately five years and includes:

- At least 70 credits (hp) of coursework
- One year of departmental duties, including teaching and supervision

Currently, I am in my first year and primarily focused on coursework, familiarizing myself with ongoing research projects, taking courses and supervising Master's students.

## Supervising and reviewing student projects

- *2025 VT*
    - **Co-Supervising master thesis projects** with Prashant Singh:
        - Viktor Bergstedt: 
            - Thesis Simulating Complex Particle Dynamics with Graph Neural Networks 
            - Other work: [BiTrain](https://github.com/BitTrain/bittrain) an experimental regression package based on bitwise classification
        - Alessia Rossi: 
            - Research project: *Adaptive Covariance Estimation in Convex Multi-Objective Optimization (ongoing)*
    - **Reviewer** for Master's thesis:
        - Linjing Shen: [Oversampling Time-Series Compositional Data for Classification of Microbiome Samples](https://uu.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?aq2=%5B%5B%5D%5D&c=1&af=%5B%5D&searchType=SIMPLE&sortOrder2=title_sort_asc&query=Oversampling+Time-Series+Compositional+Data+for+Classification+of+Microbiome+Samples&language=en&pid=diva2%3A1973870&aq=%5B%5B%5D%5D&sf=all&aqe=%5B%5D&sortOrder=author_sort_asc&onlyFullText=false&noOfRows=50&dswid=-377)

## Teaching duties

- UPCOMING (2025 HT)
    - Teaching assistant for *1TD354 Scientific Computing for Partial Differential Equations* (5.0hp)

## Other university affiliated activities

- 2025
    - [Impact hack 2025](https://www.ai.se/en/sector-initiatives/municipalities-and-civil-society/ai-impact/impact-hack-2025). Our university division team (Team-TDB) delivered a project for the  Hjärt-Lungfonden in the scope of this hackatlon. ([Our demo](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=G3PuStKkyb8))
    - Invited to held a lecture at Eötvös József College's Natural Science Camp Math section for high school students ([translated lecture notes](/Edu/notes/Matchings_2025_TTT.pdf))

## Courses / Credits taken so far (36.5 / 70.0)

- 7.5hp Advanced probabilistic machine learning - FTN0204 (2024 HT) 
- 5.0hp Statistical Machine Learning - FTN0061 (2024 HT)
- 4.0hp Numerical Linear Algebra - FTN0577 (2024 HT)
- 3.5hp Numerical Optimization - FTN0578 (2024 HT)
- 2.0hp Ethics of Technology and Science, part I - FTN0001 (2025 VT)
- 2.0hp Summer school on Generative modelling, [GEMSS and Statlearn](https://gemss.ai/2025/) (2025 VT)
- 7.5hp [Probability Theory and Statistics](https://www.troscheit.eu/news/phdcourse/) by the maths department (2025 VT)

### Future planed courses

- 10.0hp [Statistical Learning for Data Science](https://d3c-group.github.io/courses/statistical/) (2025 HT)
- 7.5hp Academic Teacher Training Course (2025 HT)
- 5.0hp Mathematical foundations of scientific computing (2025 HT)
- 5.0hp Simulation technologies (2026 VT)

### Summer Schools

- [Generative Modeling Summer School / Statlearn](https://gemss.ai/2025/) Mar 31st - Apr 4th 2025 
    - The summer school covered a broad range of topics in generative modeling, from foundational concepts such as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), Probabilistic Circuits, and Probabilistic PCA, to more advanced models including Normalizing Flows, Score-Based Diffusion Models, and Subtractive Sum-of-Squares Models.
    - The program featured excellent lectures by leading researchers, including Benjamin Billot, Gilles Louppe, Antonio Vergari, and Yingzhen Li.
    - It was also a great opportunity to meet and exchange ideas with fellow PhD students from across Europe who are working on similar research topics.

<!-- As a PhD student in the division of Scientific Computing at the Uppsala University's IT department, I feel like scientific communication is a big part of my duties. Therefore, I plan to write monthly, bi-monthly posts about my progress or other interesting topics. Some will be more about my everyday PhD life, some will be more in depth technical or philosophical articles.
