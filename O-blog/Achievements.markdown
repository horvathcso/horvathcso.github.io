I would start by saying how grateful I am for all the people who helped me during my sport journey. Special thanks to my coaches and training partners as well as to my parents who always supported me in all possible ways to have the best of both world and having to spend enormous amount of time doing different sports and still gaining a world-class education in the declining Hungarian education system. Mentioning some people and organization, which had a lasting effect on me with their support next to my parents. First, I want to mention the club [IKARUS BSE](https://www.ikarusatletika.hu/), which raised me as an athlete. I had exceptional coaches at my young age, which made me prepared to later workload without ever overtraining me. I am unable to count the number of medals I won or the memories I gained during competitions, everyday trainings and training camps in the foremost youth development athletics academy in the country.
