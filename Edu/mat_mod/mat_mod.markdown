> We call the mathematical representation of reality a mathematical modell. The mathematical modelling is the process of creating a mathematical model.

So the aim of the mathematical modelling is to describe the real world processes in a formal language for some kind of better understanding. 

Mathematical models are widely used in applied math, natural science, economics and engineering disciplines. But it is also used in the areas of human science, and almost in every area of life.

Here my goal will be to introduce a wide range of tools, which can be used for creating models, with the main focus being on the modelling and simulation, not the theory behind the separate disciplines and methods.
