<span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:1.2em;"> **Theorem:** Every girl is blonde [^1]</span>

<span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:1;"> **Proof.** It is sufficient to show that in every set of girls, any two members have the same hair color. There exists at least one blonde girl. And all the girls form a set. </span>
: <span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:1em;"> We prove the italicized statement by induction on the size of the set. If the size is one, the statement is clearly true. Suppose that the statement holds for every *n* element set of girls, and consider an *n+1* element set: *S = {Kate, Julie, Ann, Elisabeth, …}*. If *Kate* is dropped from *S*, then an *n* element set remains, and by the induction assumption, every girl in this subset has the same hair color, say *X*. Similarly, if *Julie* is dropped from *S*, then in this subset the hair color is uniform. But *Ann*’s hair is of color *X*, and so the same holds for *Kate*. Therefore, the hair color is uniformly *X* in *S*, too.</span>

Even though for many the above proof would seem correct at the first glance, it is trivial that the statement is not true. I started this page with this to point out the importance of mathematics, because what would happen to us in a world where there are only blonds:)

# Under development

My goal is to organize some of my notes into accessable format, write about topics I am interested in and create though provoking articles. The writing of such things take time and I only spend some of my free time doing it, but I hope with time I will realize at least some of my ambitions to share knowledge in my site.

For now I am updating the extended version of my handwritten lecture notes on latine squears, which can be found [here](/Edu/notes/latin-squares).

<!-- TBD
# Content collection

I produce the content of this site mainly for my own sake, but if you have questions, suggestion or requests feel free to reach out. I am also glad if you report any error/mistake you encounter.

Here is the collection of the materials I produced. Most of this materials can be also reached from the menu in the top.

## Recommendations - for problem-solving enthusiastic

### General recommendations

- I strongly recommend to all the videos of Grant Sanderson on the channel of [3blue1brown](www.3blue1brown.com)
- For computer assisted problem-solving tasks I recommend the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) site


### For non-Hungarian high school students and teachers

As a current organizer I can recommend to all interested in competitive math at the highest level to participate in the international edition of the Durer competition. For participant, it is free and there are usually many interesting problems created by former IMO team members. As a teacher you can also apply to be an official location where local children can participate in person. In this case the possibility to translate to your own language is given. Details can be found at [durerinfo.hu](https://durerinfo.hu/durer-in-english/durer-in-english-take-part-in-the-competition/). If you have any question email [maths@durerinfo.hu](mailto:maths@durerinfo.hu).

### For STEM students at ELTE

- I can only encourage peoples interested in pursuing a STEM career in Hungary to attend the math BSc at ELTE as there are great teachers and great students. As the program structure has changed a few years ago I am only partially up to date with the current structure, but if you have questions feel free to reach out to me.
- I strongly recommend joining an advanced study college there. Either the [Bolyai Collage](https://www.bolyai.elte.hu/) focusing on STEM or the [Eötvös College](www.eotvos.elte.hu), which is interdisciplinary and welcomes nearly any discipline.
- I can suggest participating in some voluntary program such as joining the [Matematika Összeköt egyesület](https://www.medvematek.hu/rolunk/szervezok), or progams of the Joy of Thinking Foundation, such as organizing the [Durer competition](https://durerinfo.hu/) or the [Repülő Iskola](https://agondolkodasorome.hu/tevekenysegeink/repulo-iskola/). These organizations can be welcoming even if your main interest is not in mathematics.


### For Hungarian school students

For Hungarian high school students interested in the STEM disciplines I am wholeheartedly recommending all activities of the [Joy of Thinking foundation](https://agondolkodasorome.hu/). If you are interested in math competitions you should visit the [https://agondolkodasorome.medium.com/](https://agondolkodasorome.medium.com/) site, where there are suggested competitions and activities based on age groups and interests from the begining of school up until adulthood.  

If you are not looking for making the team for the olimpiad, just want to enjoy interesting maths problems and have fun. I recommend the [Durer Competition](durerinfo.hu), which is a team competition in math, physics and chemistry. Its final is a two round competition with lots of fun and free time activity during three days. I, as most, started volunteering as an organizer after having an amazing experience during the competition as a participant. I would also strongly suggest the happenings of [Medve matek](https://medvematek.hu/rolunk/mokup). Even though I only have limited experience with it, I heard many great things about it both from participants and organizers. Both of this organization works mostly on the voluntary work of university students and fresh graduate enthusiastic for math.

If you are more interested in higher level competitions the monthly problem-solving competitions of the [ABACUS](http://mategye.hu/?pid=abacus/Abacus%20megrendel%F5lap) (3.-8. grade) and [KoMaL](komal.hu) (9.-12. grade) is a good possibility to regularly work on interesting problems aimed at your skill levels.

If you are interested in the highest level of competitive high school mathematics and aiming for the olimpiads then visit the official site of the [olimpics preparation](https://cms.renyi.hu/olimpiak/hu). I am strongly recommending for all girl interested in competitive math the [preparation for EGMO](https://cms.renyi.hu/olimpiak/hu/node/111). Since 2019 there is a specific program for this, and I heard from many girls who participated in the preparation that it had a lasting effect on their motivation to solve problems. For the most ambitious I can recommend the [Olimpiai iskola](https://cms.renyi.hu/olimpiak/hu/node/159) program organized by András Imolay and other former IMO participants with the aim of preparing the current students for achieving their best, by rigorous preparation.

If you are looking for math activities for yourselves or for your children in Hungary, and you couldn't find out the best possibilities based on the above feel free to reach out to me, or to the [Joy of thinking foundation](https://agondolkodasorome.hu/).
