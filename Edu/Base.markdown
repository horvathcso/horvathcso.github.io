<span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:1.2em;"> **Theorem:** Every girl is blonde [^1]</span>

<span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:1;"> **Proof.** It is sufficient to show that in every set of girls, any two members have the same hair color. Indeed, apply this to the set of all girls. Since there exists a blonde girl, every girl is blonde. </span>
: <span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:1em;"> We prove the italicized statement by induction on the size of the set. If the size is one, the statement is clearly true. Suppose that the statement holds for every *n* element set of girls, and consider an *n+1* element set: *S = {Kate, Julie, Ann, Elisabeth, …}*. If *Kate* is dropped from *S*, then an *n* element set remains, and by the induction assumption, every girl in this subset has the same hair color, say *X*. Similarly, if *Julie* is dropped from *S*, then in this subset the hair color is uniform. But *Ann*’s hair is of color *X*, and so the same holds for *Kate*. Therefore, the hair color is uniformly *X* in *S*, too.</span>

Even though for many the above proof would seem correct at the first glance, it is trivial that the statement is not true. I started this page with this to point out the importance of mathematics, because what would happen to us in a world where there are only blonds.

## Recommendations (Under constructtion)

### General recommendations

- I strongly recommend to all the videos of Grant Sanderson on the chanel of [3blue1brown](www.3blue1brown.com)
- For computer assisted problem-solving tasks I recommend the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) site


### For non-Hungarian high school students and teachers

As a current organizer I can recommend to all interested in competitive math at the highest level to participate in the international edition of the Durer competition. For participant, it is free and there are usually many interesting problems created by former IMO team members. As a teacher you can also apply to be an official location where local children can participate in person. In this case the possibility to translate to your own language is given. Details can be found at [durerinfo.hu](https://durerinfo.hu/durer-in-english/durer-in-english-take-part-in-the-competition/). If you have any question email [maths@durerinfo.hu](mailto:maths@durerinfo.hu).

### Studiing at ELTE

- I can only encourage peoples interested in pursuing a STEM career in Hungary to attend the math BSc at ELTE as there are great teachers and great students. As the program structure has changed a few years ago I can't share much valuable insight about the current courses.
- I strongly recommend joining a special college there. Either the [Bolyai Collage](https://www.bolyai.elte.hu/) for STEM or the [Eötvös College](www.eotvos.elte.hu) for nearly any discipline.
- I can suggest participating in some voluntary maths program such as joining the [Matematika Összeköt egyesület](https://www.medvematek.hu/rolunk/szervezok), or progams of the Joy of Thinking Foundation, such as organizing the [Durer competition](https://durerinfo.hu/) or the [Repülő Iskola](https://agondolkodasorome.hu/tevekenysegeink/repulo-iskola/).


### For Hungarian school students

For Hungarian high school students interested in the STEM disciplines I am wholeheartedly recommending all activity of the [Joy of Thinking foundation](https://agondolkodasorome.hu/). If you are interested in math competitions you should visit the [https://agondolkodasorome.medium.com/](https://agondolkodasorome.medium.com/) site, where there are suggested competitions and activities based on age groups and interests from the beggining of school up until adulthood.  

If you are not looking for making the team for the olimpiad, just want to enjoy interesting maths problems and have fun. I recommend the [Durer Competition](durerinfo.hu), which is a team competition in math, physics and chemistry. And its final is a two round competition with lots of fun free time activity during a weekend. I as most started volunteering as an organizer after having an amazing experience during the competition as a participant. I would also strongly suggest the happenings of [Medve matek](https://medvematek.hu/rolunk/mokup). Even though I only have limited experience with it, I heard many great things about it both from participants and organizers. Both of this organization works mostly on the voluntary work of university students and fresh graduate enthusiastic for math.

For more interested the monthly problem-solving competitions of the [ABACUS](http://mategye.hu/?pid=abacus/Abacus%20megrendel%F5lap) (3.-8. grade) and [KoMaL](komal.hu) (9.-12. grade) is a good possibility to regularly work on interesting problems created for their own age.

If you are interested in the highest level of competitive high school mathematics and aiming for the olimpiads then visit the official site of the [olimpics preparation](https://cms.renyi.hu/olimpiak/hu). I am strongly recommending for all interested girl the [preparation for EGMO](https://cms.renyi.hu/olimpiak/hu/node/111) as since 2019 there is a specific program for this, and I heard from many girls who participated in the preparation that it had a lasting effect on their motivation to solve problems in an only girl atmosphere. For the most ambitious I can recommend the [Olimpiai iskola](https://cms.renyi.hu/olimpiak/hu/node/159) program organized by András Imolay and other former IMO participants with the aim of preparing the current students for achieving the best, by rigorous preparation.
