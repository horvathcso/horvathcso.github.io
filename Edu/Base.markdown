<span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:1.2em;"> **Theorem:** Every girl is blonde [^1]</span>

<span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:1;"> **Proof.** It is sufficient to show that in every set of girls, any two members have the same hair color. Indeed, apply this to the set of all girls. Since there exists a blonde girl, every girl is blonde.</span>
: <span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:1em;"> We prove the italicized statement by induction on the size of the set. If the size is one, the statement is clearly true. Suppose that the statement holds for every *n* element set of girls, and consider an *n+1* element set: *S = {Kate, Julie, Ann, Elisabeth, …}*. If *Kate* is dropped from *S*, then an *n* element set remains, and by the induction assumption, every girl in this subset has the same hair color, say *X*. Similarly, if *Julie* is dropped from *S*, then in this subset the hair color is uniform. But *Ann*’s hair is of color *X*, and so the same holds for *Kate*. Therefore the hair color is uniformly *X* in *S*, too.</span>

Even though for many the above proof would seem correct at the first glance, it is trivial that the statement is not true. I started this page with this to point out the importance of mathematics, because what would happen with us in a world where there are only blonds.

# My professional interest

On a more serious note I will write a bit about my professional interests inside math and computer science. I have a pure math bachelor from ELTE (Hungary) and I am currently doing my master in computational science in Uppsala University. About my education you can find more at my [CV site](/about/CV). 

Throughout my academic journey, my passion for mathematics has been deeply intertwined with the most influential domains in Hungarian mathematics. From my early years in high school, I developed a profound interest in discrete mathematics, with a particular fascination for graph theory and combinatorics. Within graph theory, I am particularly interested in coloring problems and network flows, additionally the characterization of various classes of graphs has always had a great impact on me, which was also the topics of my bachelor thesis titles: [*Chordal graphs and leaf powers* (Hungarian)](https://www.math.elte.hu/thesisupload/thesisfiles/2022bsc_mat3y-xfhq76.pdf).

In addition to these areas, during my bachelor I became familiar with and interested in operations research and optimization tasks in general, including game theory problems. I also found my computational theory subject to be extremely interesting.

In the past year, during my master's degree, I began to show a deep interest in new fields, as I gained more insight into the given subject. One of which was the numerical modeling of differential equations, primarily using FEM and FDM. Still on the theoretical side, I found a deeper interest for mathematical modeling, during my class on modeling complex systems.
: In addition, I was lucky enough to learn about low-level and parallel programming using C and pthread/MP/MPI, which I also liked.

During my next year I am most likely to do my master thesis in the field of machine learning focusing on the aspects of non-convex optimization for ML and the examination of the loss landscape. I always find the application results of neural networks interesting and I gained a deep theoretical background on the topics. But mainly due to the too much hype this area receives, until now I wasn't  intriguing enough to spend more time examining this topics.
