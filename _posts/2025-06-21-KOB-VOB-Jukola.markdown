Finally I managed to start writing this blog as I planned it for a while now. My hope is to write somewhat regular updates about my trainings and competitions, mostly for myself and for anyone interested in reading it.

In the end of May, was the Hungarian Middle and Relay Championship organized next to Pécs in the fills of the Mecsek. The program was a a middle final on Saturday and the Relay on Sunday.

As from this year the qualification for the middle was cancaled and due to the strange setup of hungarian ranking for the elite level (multiple people even the ones livin in Hungary can lack sufficient ranking), I wasn't part of the red group, which are the people starting in the back. And I ended up starting second, which already demotivated me days before the race when the startlist come out. 

Therefore I went to warm up long before most people started walking to rech the start area by the time of it's lock down. Thus I had a calm and empty space to warm up and then I started out 4 minutes after null time to the forest.

I started with a 30 sec mistake to the first controll, then not counting some small hesitations and suboptimal routchoice, I did nice orienteering to the finish. As my shape, especially for hills, is not the best. And based on the map I was preparing for more challanging tasks, my speed was slower than the others and the deffensive orienteering after the first control didn't paid off.

In the end I was 19th with a tie of 40:18, 7:17 behind. Probably I would have ran faster with a later start time as there were some dense part which made me very slow, but it would have been still my worth ever placement in a championship probably.

On Sunday, the Relay Championship took place. Based on our middle-distance performance earlier in the weekend, we knew that winning was out of reach, but a podium finish was still a realistic and motivating goal.

Tamás took the first leg for us and delivered a solid run, but by the time he handed over, we were already about three minutes behind the leading trio. That meant we had a mountain to climb, but also an opportunity if the race unfolded in our favor.

<img style="float: left; margin: 5px 20px; border-radius:20px;" src="\img\blog\2025vob.jpg" alt="Profile picture" width="20%" height="20%">

I started the second leg with a pack of chasers right on my heels, which put me under pressure from the very beginning. I opted for safe route choices early on, trying to keep mistakes to a minimum. Still, I was quickly caught by Daniil and Gábor Vellner. Running with them was a struggle at times, and on the long leg I made the wrong decision, abandoned my original plan to follow their route, which I hadn’t realized was significantly slower. Ironically, I ended up catching the control alone anyway.

After that, I had a brief hesitation at the next control, but managed to settle into a rhythm of slow but steady orienteering. Once we reached the faster, more runnable parts of the course, I began to push harder, but that’s where mistakes crept in. I lost over a minute trying to relocate myself on a road just before a control, then managed well until the spectator passage. In the second loop, though, I slipped again with another error costing around 90 seconds.

Fortunately for me, the other second-leg runners, aside from Daniil, whose team was already out due to a mispunch, weren’t performing much better. That allowed me to exchange in second place, about 2.5 minutes behind Peti Nagy (SPA) and with a two-minute gap ahead of the next teams.

On the final leg, our most experienced runner, Zsolt Lenei, kept the pressure on with another solid performance. Thanks to several mistakes from Mihály in the leading team, we even managed to close the gap slightly.

In the end, all three of us had runs where we could point to at least a few minute lost. If we had been cleaner, that collective time gain would have been enough to fight for victory. But given that there were two stronger team: SPA (Zolti, Bika, Misi) and SZV (Ádám, Daniil, Feri). We can’t be too disappointed. Securing our final placement against such strong teams is still something to be proud of, and it shows the potential we have when everything clicks together.
